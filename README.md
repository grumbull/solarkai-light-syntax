# Solarkai

Solarkai is a syntax theme for atom that uses a solarized color palette with monokai-style syntax highlighting.

* Color values are from Ethan Shoonover's [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
* This repo was forked from [kevinsawicki/monokai](http://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai) to easily conserve the monokai coloring.
